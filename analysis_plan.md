This is the suggested analysis plan foe the outlier detection

## Reading we need to do

* Look at Nipy's diagnostics (put link in ther)
* Reviwe Principal Component Analysis (Where)
* Review FSL's ICA method

## Action plan

Use simplest possible outlier detection to get `find_outlier.py`to wprk.
Review methods above and try variants.
